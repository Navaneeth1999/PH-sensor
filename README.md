pH Sensor with Arduino and Display System
The pH Sensor with Arduino and Display System is a compact and efficient solution for measuring and displaying the pH levels of soil or water. By connecting the pH sensor to an Arduino microcontroller, the system can accurately monitor the acidity or alkalinity of the soil or liquid and present the real-time data on an LCD or OLED screen. This system is essential for applications in agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, and environmental monitoring, where maintaining an optimal pH range is crucial for plant growth and water quality.

Key Features:
Real-time pH Monitoring: Provides continuous, real-time pH level readings of soil or water to ensure ideal conditions for crops or aquatic systems.
Clear Display: The data is presented on a user-friendly LCD/OLED screen, making it easy to track pH changes over time.
Threshold Alerts: Can be programmed to alert the user when pH levels fall outside the desired range, allowing for quick corrective actions.
Portable and Efficient: The Arduino-based system is designed for low power consumption and portability, making it suitable for field use or controlled environments.
Data Logging Capabilities: With additional modules, pH data can be logged and analyzed over time to track changes and make informed decisions for soil or water management.
Modular Design: Compatible with other sensors (such as NPK, moisture, or temperature sensors), enabling a complete soil or environmental monitoring system.
